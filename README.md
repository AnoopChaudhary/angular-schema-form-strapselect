Looking for maintainer
======================
I have switched from Angular to React and in a process to convert all my forms to [react-schema-form](https://github.com/networknt/react-schema-form)

It looks like there are still users for this Angular add-on and I am wondering if someone wants to take over the ownership to maintain this module. Thanks.


angular-schema-form-strapselect
===============================

AngularStrap Select implementation that supports Ajax call to the back end for Angular Schema Form


Video demos for both strapselect and uiselect
